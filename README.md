# Climate Dash

Well actually this turned into a covid-19 dashboard experiment.

# Installation

First step is to clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/jackaranda/climatedash.git
```

I use virtualenv to manage packages, you don't have to do this but if you want to create a local virtualenv you can:
```
virtualenv climatedash
```

Then install all the required packages
````
cd climatedash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the app just run it
```
cd app
python plot.py
```
